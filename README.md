# Overview

This assumes a 3DSpace, Geoscience Survey Service coupled architecture. Meaning that the artefact id's may be either id's from 3DSpace or GSS, depending on whether said artefact has p&O that is managed in 3DSpace.

This might still change.

Based upon benchmarks run, a GDS query against many millions of boreholes may take at least a minute to execute which may need to be accounted for in the UI.
